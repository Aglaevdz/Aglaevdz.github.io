'#Variables'- The definition of a variable is, the location that allows you to store information. The variable is the location where the information resides. I didn't grasp the concept of this. Yes it's easy to read it and say "okay got it" but not until you start to utilize the different types of variables, did I fully understand how they work. There are different types of variable too. You have your local variables (they begin with a lowercase letter, majority of  the time). Constant variables begin with Uppercase letters. Class variables which have the @@ before the name. And what have become my favorite are the instant variable, they begin with a single @, these are normally found in the initialization. Variables store your information. The value can be changed but your variable name will remain the same that's why its important for them to have a meaningful name. Makes the program more meaningful. So in essence without variables there is no code, no information, no program. The more I learned the importance of these and how to work with them the easier the lessons became.
