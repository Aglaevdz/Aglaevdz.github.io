For many years I have been interested in computer systems. While in High School the closes course I could take to programming was computer science that taught the most basics of how to use a computer and an electronic course that taught all the electronic functions of a radio and briefly touched on how computers were built. I was amazed with the technology and was top in my class. Out of 15 students in the electronics class only one other classmate and I were successfully able to build a working radio. I was happy but not content. I wanted to learn what programs made a computer run, but felt the computer language was too difficult to understand. So when I married in 1997 I decided to put that interest on hold. I was going to become a wife and aim to become a mom and the duties that those two titles carry were going to be enough to suffice my interest. 

Well 20 plus years later I am still a wife, but didn't become a mom. I've worked in the credit and collections environment my entire career, but it's never been something I truly enjoy. They say that if you work at the job you like it doesn't feel like work. I feel as if I work all the time! Every so often I question myself if I am truly content with my job , and every time I come back to programs, if only I was smart enough to learn them.

I have a supporting husband who has allowed me to invest in different hobbies such as photography, sewing, gardening and even learning another language. Yes I said sewing. That was a mess. I quickly learned that sewing takes talent and patience I had not yet acquired at the time. Sadly hobbies don't pay the bills, nor help set you up for retirement.

So here I am. When the servers at work are constantly having to be rebooted because the program crashed I get more and more curious as to why. I decided to stop asking why and learn. Quick side note, three years ago my husband and I decided to start to learn Mandarin Chinese as a hobby. We both have always liked the culture and even have traveled to China and Taiwan. Both places are amazing to travel to. The food was amazing, and being new language learners at the time it helped us become determined to learn to speak it. We are still learning it and working on it. It's been a challenge but I see the progress in both of us. So, if I can continue to learn Mandarin, I know I can learn the computer language. It's amazing what our brains can do when we feed them new information. We have amazing computers working within us. I now am determined and really want to learn the computers that help us run our lives.  They have become a daily necessity and I want to be smarter than them. So I feel now is the best time to learn and finding Flatiron to help me has only been a bonus and a blessing. Even though its taken me 20 years to get here, I don't regret it because I'm here now. My new adventure begins.
